    "In Python, there are several different ways to create visualizations. In fact, `pandas` has its own visualization capabilities, all of which are built on top of `matplotlib`! For example, you could have created the histogram from the previous exercise using `recent_grads.sharewomen(kind=\"hist\")` instead of `plt.hist(recent_grads.sharewomen)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which approach you prefer comes down to personal preference - when working with DataFrames, it is advantageous to use `pandas`' plotting capabilities because the code tends to be less verbose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, you will practice creating the plots from the previous exercises using `pandas` instead of `matplotlib`. All `pandas` plots are created using the `.plot()` method on a DataFrame. Inside `.plot()`, you can specify which plot you want to create using the `kind` parameter. For example, `kind= 'hist'` would create a histogram, `kind='scatter'` would create a scatter plot, and so on.\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "- Use the `.plot()` method with `kind='scatter'` on the `dept_stats` DataFrame to create a scatter plot with `'unemployment_rate'` on the x-axis and `'low_wage_jobs'` on the y-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now, create a histogram of the `sharewomen` column of the `recent_grads` DataFrame. "
